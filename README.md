## What's inside

- React
- Redux
- Redux Thunk
  - With Redux Thunk it's possible to have async actions on the redux store. This way it's possible to wrap API fetching on the Redux reducers and focus on the interface.
- Styled Components
  - Styled Components provide a better way to wrap style inside the component itself, it does not use inline styles and provides easy extends features
